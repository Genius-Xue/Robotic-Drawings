# Robotic-Drawings

The assignment aims to:

1. Get us familiar to the fundamentals of robotics, such as kinematics, dynamics, and control which help us understand how the robot moves and reacts to different inputs.

2. Know the robot's capabilities and limitations: such as the robot's reach, payload capacity, speed, and precision.

3. Practice programming: Develop programming skills to create motion sequences and control the robot's movements.

4. Optimize the robot's movements: To achieve the best performance, optimize the robot's movements by minimizing joint movements, maximizing accuracy, and minimizing the time it takes to complete a task.
