# Robotic-Drawings

1. The assignment aims to get us familiar to the fundamentals of robotics, such as kinematics, dynamics, and control which help us understand how the robot moves and reacts to different inputs.

2. Know the robot's capabilities and limitations: such as the robot's reach, payload capacity, speed, and precision.

Practice programming: Develop programming skills to create motion sequences and control the robot's movements. You can use software like Robot Operating System (ROS) or teach pendant programming to program the robot.

Use sensors: Sensors such as cameras, force/torque sensors, and proximity sensors can help the robot interact with its environment and detect changes in position or force.

Optimize the robot's movements: To achieve the best performance, optimize the robot's movements by minimizing joint movements, maximizing accuracy, and minimizing the time it takes to complete a task.

Safety: Always ensure the safety of yourself and those around you by following safety protocols, such as placing barriers around the robot and ensuring the robot is switched off before performing maintenance.

Continuously learn and improve: Robotics technology is constantly evolving, so it's important to stay up to date with the latest developments and techniques. Keep learning and improving your skills to stay at the forefront of the field.
